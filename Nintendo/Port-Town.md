**Port Town** (Japanese: <span lang="ja">ポートタウン</span>, Hepburn: _Pōto Taun_) is famously known as an intergalactic trades center and the home of bounty hunter and F-ZERO racer, [Captain Falcon](Nintendo/Captain-Falcon), who lives off the coast on a chain of islands. Port Town’s architecture is marked by towering skyscrapers, pyramid-shaped office buildings and is bordered by mountains. A giant construction robot that looks like R.O.B. in Famicom colors can be seen in the background on top of two buildings in _F-ZERO GX_.
