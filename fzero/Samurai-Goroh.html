<blockquote>“I can’t lose in my Fire Stingray!”<br>—Samurai Goroh in Red Canyon, before racing Falcon in <i>GX</i>.</blockquote>
<p><b>Samurai Goroh</b> (Japanese: <span lang="ja">サムライ ゴロー</span>, Hepburn: <i>Samurai Gorō</i>) is an F-Zero pilot first introduced in <i>F-Zero</i>. He is co-created by Takaya Imamura and Shigeru Miyamoto. The character’s first appearance took place in the instruction manual of 1990 video game <i>F-Zero</i>, not until a later release has the character actually appeared in-game and his model conveyed by a computer-generated image. Outside the <i>F-Zero</i> series, Samurai Goroh has also appeared in <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i>, and the later <i>Smash Bros.</i> games, as an Assist Trophy.</p>
<p>Samurai Goroh wields a katana very well and is the father of Dai Goroh in the main series and the husband of Lisa Brilliant in the anime series, which has no connection to the games prior to its creation. Samurai Goroh’s reason for joining <i>F-Zero</i> is because of his rivalry with Captain Falcon. Goroh races in an F-Zero machine called the Fire Stingray. While it was recorded to be the fastest machine out of the four original pilots, it is rumored that the Fire Stingray is actually stolen property.</p>
